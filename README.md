# LSTM-CNN Human Activity Recognition

This project is a human behavioral activity recognition model based on LSTM (Long short-term memory) and CNN (Convolutional neural network). The model can process the data collected by wearable sensors of the human body to automatically recognize different behavioral activities, such as walking, running, and climbing stairs. We selected the Network Open Data set, WISDM and UCI-HAR.

## Features

LSTM-CNN combined deep learning model that effectively learns and recognizes human activities from sensor data.

Supports multi-class human activity classification, capable of recognizing various types of activities.

Provides data preprocessing functionalities including data cleaning, feature extraction, and data splitting for model training and testing.

Offers model training and testing capabilities, allowing training and evaluation on your own dataset.
