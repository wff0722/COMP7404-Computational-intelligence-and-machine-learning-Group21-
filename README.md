#LSTM-CNN Human Activity Recognition
This project is a deep learning model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for human activity recognition. The model can automatically identify different human activities, such as walking, running, and climbing stairs, by processing sensor data.

##Features
LSTM-CNN combined deep learning model that effectively learns and recognizes human activities from sensor data.
Supports multi-class human activity classification, capable of recognizing various types of activities.
Provides data preprocessing functionalities including data cleaning, feature extraction, and data splitting for model training and testing.
Offers model training and testing capabilities, allowing training and evaluation on your own dataset.
